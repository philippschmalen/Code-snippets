# Code snippets (I find useful)

A collection of code that I picked up and wrote down while wandering through the web from online courses, blog posts and other great sources. 

Happy to hear your thoughts, get tips to become better or even ideas to expand the collection. 

## Content

1. Out-of-the-box PCA: PCA_workflow.ipynb
1. Using decorators to get function timing: timing_decorator_function.py
1. Handle missing values in a structures way: Handle Missing Values.ipynb 


### TODO

- [x] refactor PCA_workflow
- [ ] write PCA_analysis class
- [ ] review add functionality to Handle Missing Values

### Ideas

- apply OOP to probability distributions (Gaussian and binomial)
